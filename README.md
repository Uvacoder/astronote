# Astronote

A markdwon based note taking plus productivity app for writers and developers.

## Instalation

### Step 1

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohid2d/astronote
```

### Step 2

Move inside the project folder and install npm dependencies. I'm using `pnpm`. So make sure you have `pnpm` installed globaly in your system.

```bash
cd astronote
pnpm i
```

## Run

This project is a monorepo built on top of turborepo. You can run this command from the project root to start all the dev services at once.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Build

Same as run, to build this you can simply run this command

```bash
pnpm build
```
